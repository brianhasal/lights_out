# Lights Out

## Exercise Overview

**Lights Out** was (is?) a handheld electronic game produced by Tiger Electronics produced in the '90s. And you can even still [buy it today on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Tiger-Lights-Out-Handheld-Game/dp/B000UHABZC).

The game consists of a grid of 5x5 buttons that can light up, and the goal of the game is to turn all the lights off. Pressing each button would toggle the light of that button. (By toggle, we mean that if the light was on, it would turn off. If it was off, it would turn on.) But here's the catch: When pressing any button, that would automatically toggle the lights of *all adjacent buttons as well*.

It's worth skimming the game's [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) for more info. Also, at the bottom of that article, there's a link to an online playable version of the game.
